Not really sure what to say? This is a node_blog app that I am working on. I am using Node2Blog https://github.com/jawerty/Node2Blog as a base point to start from. So far I have just made minor revisions in the code.

This will be a great place to start learning how to build my own blogging engine, but the thing is, most of this is stuff is already written. I'll probably end up just repackaging modules already written, and my own. Thanks for reading, and a big thanks to Jared Wright.
